      <h1>TIME!</h1>
      <p>Here's a collection of bad or interesting timetelling:</p>
      <a href="newtime.html"><h2>Madtime!</h2></a><p>This is a weird time notation i made, based on my subjective opinion of what values are more important. Try finding out what's going on!<br> Solution: <span class:"spoiler">First day, then hour + minute. After that: Month, year, century and finally seconds.</span></p>
      <a href="fuk-u-sincy.html"><h2>Madtime 2.0!</h2></a><p>Same as above, but a friend wanted me to display AM/PM before the rest.</p>
      <a href="hex.html"><h2>Hex time!</h2></a><p>Hexadecimal time, where the first two digits mark the day (and that's why the red channel only goes up to decimal 31), the rest marks the hour. Everything is displayed as a hex colour in the page background.</p>
      <a href="hex2.html"><h2>Hex time 2.0!</h2></a><p>Improved version of the above. The first two digits mark how far we are into the year.</p>
      <a href="hex3.html"><h2>Hex time 3.0!</h2></a><p>Improved version of the above. If you want the same time to pass between each colour change you'll have to suffer under  horrible colour combinations.</p>
      <a href="111.html"><h2>Unary!</h2></a><p>Normal clock but 0 = |, 1 = ||, 2 = ||| and so on.</p>
        <a href="doppel.html"><h2>Metric time</h2></a><p>This one is very cool! The first text field changes how many hours a day has, the second one how many minutes an hour has, and the last one changes the number of seconds in a minute!</p>
