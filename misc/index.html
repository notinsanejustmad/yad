      <div id="intro"><p>I like doing random stuff and while this doesn't fit with the rest of the website, which is rather set out to showcase my conlang(s), so i decided to put it here! For faster access just click the links in the navigation bar above, but if you want to see some explanations about what each link is, just look below!</p></div>
      <div id="lang"><a href="langim.html"><h2>Language!</h2></a><p>This is the subpage I will be using for some stuff i decided to do because of boredom (like most stuff on here), which has to do with natlangs. Here you will see a collection of pronouns, verb conjugation and other tables i put together from different languages. This includes languages like Russian, German and Spanish (not english 'cause i dont think that is necessary, but i might add it in the future).<br></p></div>
      <div id="colour"><a href="../colour/index.html"><h2>Colours!</h2></a><p>This isn't that mindbreaking, you will have most likely have seen this on other websites before, but i thought I'd try to make my own. Here you will find a colour picker and a random colour generator. Have fun!<br></p></div>
