      <p>Two figures approach each other on a parking lot. While there's still some distance between them, the man in a large coat speaks up: "Hey, you carrying any weapons; are there any turrets in the car behind you?" "Nah, don't worry we are unturreted.", replied the hatted man. "Did you just assume about my turretment status?". <br>
"No, I am using first person plural exclusive." the Hat says and slows his pace, quickly coming to halt. "Oh." says the Coat and stops aswell. Both stand in silence, staring at each other, until the man with the hat dares to speak up: "Look, this is why English is bad."</p>
