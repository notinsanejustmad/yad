      <h1>Second Time</h1>
    </header>
     <main>   
    <p>first one, then two, then three, then four.<br>
Five passing through, then six: there's more.<br>
They carry time, they carry power:<br>
      thousands pass within an hour.</p>

<p>broken metal, rotten food,<br>
crooked backs and changing mood.<br>
For all our efforts, all the fuss,<br>
  this is what they do to us.</p>

<p>The first, the second, one a time,<br>
just ignored it feels just fine.<br>
Minutes, seconds, one more time,<br>
  i sit here and find a rhyme.</p>
    </main>
