      <h1>Realization</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>When I am walking outside, lost in thought sometimes I suddenly come to the realization that I exist. I ask myself if I existed before that point, while walking or if I was on autopilot. Do those thoughts even belong to me? Maybe they're some hidden truth of who I really am. But I wouldn't know, those thoughts are lost for me from the moment I begin to exist.<br>
Sometimes when I start existing a small fear fills me. If I look back now, will I see myself walking too slow? Once i have that thought I start walking faster, I don't want myself to reach me. And so I walk faster and faster, thinking about the possibility of myself walking back there, not yet realizing they exist. I always think about this this some time, I'm not sure how long, before realizing that I exist.</p>
