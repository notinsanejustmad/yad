<p>I'm sitting on top of a mountain watching the village below: "Hey... what should we do?". "Why don't you just enjoy the view." they respond. And i do that.<br>
I can't see any car, can't spot a single person. The sky is leaning towards the nighttime and yet no lights are on. The village seems quiet, almost idyllic. <br>
No trace of it.<br>
I sit quiet with them watching nothing happen. The sun has completely gone down and the few automatic streetlights have turned on, leaving small parts of the village lit while others are submerged in darkness.<br>
Finally i get up. "I'm going back down there" I say, mostly to myself. I walk until i reach the village, even though i know i won't find anyone.</p>
