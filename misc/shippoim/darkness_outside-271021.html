    <h1>Darkness Outside</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
    <p>Its dark outside, I can't see far. It seems as if the world is reduced to just here, the darkness outside swallowing everything else.<br>
Inside, illuminated only by the flickering glow of my candle, is the polar opposite of the dark cosmos outside, my light acting as a shield to the outside world. Who knows if there's anything sentient out there, maybe I'm the only one who can think about this.<br>
This room is cramped. There's not much here physically, yet the entire room is filled with ghosts: ideas, memories and all sorts of thoughts flying through the empty space. They enjoy my presence and I treasure theirs. It may seem as if they have infested this space, robbing me of my space and freedom. This is not entirely true. They might do that but I don't want to interrupt them, I value what they give me. Little specters from the past, the present and of what will be.<br>
I continue writing, I don't want to lose what they give me just yet, but soon I will run out of paper and ink, we'll have to think of something else.<br>
Is it just me or did I just see a light out there? I could've sworn I saw the fire of another candle in the darkness. But I can't give myself false hopes. It isn't good for me to look into this darkness, I'll end up disappointed. And of what use is it if I have enough company in here?<br>
And just like that I keep writing, knowingly oblivious of what might be, everything reduced to my small world.<br>
