      <h1>New Milk</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>It's raining. I run as i see an open cafe. It has a sign out front, the letters are running from the rain but I can make out what it says: "New: oat milk". I decide to go in, as there really isn't another option unless i want to get wet and go to buy a drink.<br>
I settle for a hot chocolate with oat milk, perfect to wait out the rain and I've always wanted to try it out. I sit down and take a sip. The warmth enters my body as I lean back and close my eyes.<br>
When i open my eyes again the cafe is gone. I'm still sitting on the chair. But around me everything is changed. I am in a vast white room and the only object I can see is a big statue of a woman holding a scale with an ornamented door in front of it. I go towards it and inspect the door. I try to open it but it seems locked. I turn around but suddenly hear a booming voice from above: "Welcome mortal. What will your vow be?". I take a few steps backwards as i see the statue moving: "A vow?", I stutter. "Everyone who comes here must take a vow which they must follow into eternity." the booming voice replies. I think for a second and then say while a bit annoyed: "I'll never spend money for something like this again".<br>
The statue stops moving and the door swings open. I enter it and suddenly find myself back in the cafe. A barista looks over to me and smiles: "You must've tried out our oath milk."</p>
