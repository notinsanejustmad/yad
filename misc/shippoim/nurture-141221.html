<p>Once again I am walking, or maybe I'm sitting in a room listening to music or just staring into space. I've been doing whatever I am doing for a while now, my awareness swallowed by thoughts. My mind is jumping from thought to thought, just like one switches channels trying to find something worth watching, until it finds a thought entertaining enough to let it develop for more than a second.<br>
I watch it grow, like a mother her child and I let myself be entertained by what it shows me. Some thoughts grow out to be insights into the world or even myself. Some turn out to be an interesting new view on something I already knew. Most of them are just shapes, colours, sounds. Sensory sensations brought to my brain like offerings to be let in. I like to experience these, being sucked into a world created by this thought and escaping from everything else for a moment. <br>
But I know that after this there's always a point I have to kill it. Be it an intervention from outside or my mind seeking a new exciting thought, the growth of my thought is stopped to allow space for a new one. It's sad to see a good thought go but this feeling only lasts for a short while until I am already engulfed by new ideas from a new thought. Some weeks, maybe even months or years into the future I will come across an old thought again and be nostalgic of the first time I saw it.</p>
