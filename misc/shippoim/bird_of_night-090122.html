      <h1>Bird of Night</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Day is sleeping, dark and silent,<br>
night is watching over me.<br>
Long I watch the woods so quiet,<br>
wait for anything I see.<br>
Black and glossy feathers flutter<br>
of a bird as black as night.<br>
Struck by awe and admiration<br>
by this beauty of a sight<br>
want to go in desperation<br>
to the bird, a blinding light.<br>
just like that, I see it shudder<br>
        the bird leaves, it used its flight.</p>
