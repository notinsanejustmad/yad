      <p>Little legs so cute and green,<br>
the cutest I have ever seen.<br>
you get ready, jump up high,<br>
        I think you might just reach the sky.</p>

<p>Smallest eyes so cute and brown,<br>
the smallest I have ever known.<br>
I look at you and you look back,<br>
  you pierce my soul, know what I lack.</p>

<p>Bodies of such brilliant hues,<br>
such great yellows, the best of blues.<br>
content smile once you get food,<br>
  with tenderness I boop your snoot.</p>
