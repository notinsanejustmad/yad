    <main>
      <p>Long was it dark, long time it's cold.<br>
Great big robes, they seem so old.<br>
Long lost hope, no sign of new,<br>
        when come the times that we once knew?</p>

<p>Oh, it breaks, the robe so black.<br>
I see fire through that crack.<br>
Light shines through, upon our lands,<br>
  As they rise, they send their hands.</p>

<p>Oh, a head of fire red,<br>
Heat and colour it has fed,<br>
dressed in robes in colours blue,<br>
  to us: new love the old withdrew.</p>

<p>Hour by hour, they rise so fast,<br>
on the old a curse have cast.<br>
All of us, we watch and nod,<br>
  we welcome it, the birth of god.</p>
