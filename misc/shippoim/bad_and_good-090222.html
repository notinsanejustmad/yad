      <h1>Bad and Good</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>On a day that's just like this<br>
        <i>I walk my way monotonously.</i><br>
Hoping for a day of bliss<br>
        <i>I walk listening to music.</i></p>

<p>The music good, my pace is fast,<br>
  <i>I think as I walk in sorrow,</i><br>
the faster it is the better at last,<br>
  <i>and the faster I'll meet my demise.</i></p>

<p>And In my head the thoughts so rich<br>
  <i>oh so many, I lose my count.</i><br>
I hear them all for I cant choose which,<br>
  <i>and all are equally horrible.</i></p>

<p>But as I walk I understand it soon<br>
  <i>the bad wins over good,</i><br>
like the thoughts over my tune<br>
  <i>or bad lines in a good poem.</i></p>
