      <h1>Mountain Trail</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>I'm walking alone on a mountain trail. The forest is quiet, the only sounds are my footsteps and occasionally a bird singing. "Are we going all the way up?" I ask. "Sure, if you want us to". "Of course I'd want to, but I'm not sure if we'll make it..", I say and then fall silent. <br>
I keep on walking for a while, until i reach a bench: "I need a break." I say and sit down. I can see everything from up here. But i need to keep going. I stand up and continue walking to reach the top of the mountain. The forest is still quiet and the only sounds are our footsteps.</p>
