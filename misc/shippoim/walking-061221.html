      <h1>Walking</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>I'm walking down the street. The trees seem to enclose me more and more with each step. I can see their bark, scratched and mistreated and I think about who did this to them. I try talking to them, without really expecting an answer but lose myself in thought and find myself working out a dialogue with them in my head. I ask them who did this, who hurt them, and they answer. There's always bad people out there, people wanting to hurt you. The trees can't do anything, they can't run. They can't run and they have to watch. Everything that happens to them and to others. I imagine this to be horrible, but what do I know. I habe the ability to run away from my fears, they have to confront them. I pity them.</p>
      <p>I walk further, noticing the detail in the walls. "This wasn't jere yesterday", I think to myself but keep walking at a steady pace. The moss and discoloration on the walls occupies my mind for a few more seconds but then disappears.</p>
      <p>I walk further, each step on the beat of my music. The world might be happening around me right now but that's none of my business in this moment. Everything disappears as I walk, all that's left is the beat of my steps. "Am I thinking or is the music thinking for me?". This question pops into my mind and fills it. I don't know how to answer it, the music is a part of me at this moment. But as quick as it came it's gone again and I am back, the world being of my concern again. I notice that I am walking slow and increase my speed, walking away from my self.</p>
      <p>slow and increase my speed, walking away from my self.
At this point I'm almost there. I'm crossing the bridge, roaring cars left and right, busy like ants, running over the vast streets below. I come to a stop for a moment, for the first time in my journey, and I observe. I look into the distance, trying to see where it ends, but the street goes on as long as the world goes. I assume it doesn't end and just loops back to the other side. On the sides of the road I see two walls of plants imprisoning the street betwixt each other, the cars moving like inmates one step at a time. Finally I look down the bridge. I think about jumping down, I think about it's height and if I would really die. But I force myself to leave this thought be after a few seconds of consideration. It would just be an inconvenience to all the people below me, I don't want them to be bothered by me.</p>
      <p>So I keep on walking. I'm nearly home, just one song more. People pass by me, I think about their thoughts but conclude that these people are too opaque for me to understand. I hear snippets of a conversation and I, assuming it's criticizing me, feel bad about trying to think what they think.</p>
      <p> Once again I walk faster. I notice houses around me. There were houses before but I hadn't thought about them. I stare into the window of one of them. The window stares back and so does the person behind it and suddenly I become aware of myself. I carry on walking quickly, hoping to never meet this person.</p>
      <p> Now, finally, the song is ending and I can see my house. Before another song can start I pull out my headphones out of my ears and walk the last few steps humming the melody to myself. At last I reach the door and open it, and I know, that with that motion I have forgotten everything that happened on this walk.</p>
