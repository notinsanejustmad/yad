We are both sitting in the room. The clock is ticking. The hands are approaching 12 more and more.
It's almost over. Almost tomorrow.
"So, what do you plan to do when this is over?" I ask. "I don't know, probably the same as you..", they reply, "what about you?". "Yea, same" I say.
We sit in silence, the clock is ticking and the hands are 12 more and more. And we are just sitting in our chairs.
Now the clock hands are pointing both to the 12. "It's over" I say relieved. They clear their throat, get up and walk out of the room. It's over.
