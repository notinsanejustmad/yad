      </p>We are both sitting in the room. The clock is ticking. The hands are approaching 12 more and more.<br>
It's almost over. Almost tomorrow.<br>
"So, what do you plan to do when this is over?" I ask. "I don't know, probably the same as you..", they reply, "what about you?". "Yea, same" I say.<br>
We sit in silence, the clock is ticking and the hands are 12 more and more. And we are just sitting in our chairs.<br>
Now the clock hands are pointing both to the 12. "It's over" I say relieved. They clear their throat, get up and walk out of the room. It's over.</p>
