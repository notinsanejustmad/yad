      <p>"One at a time, don't hurry, don't be too slow, everyone has their turn sometime." I hear from the other side of the room. "Every second one gets to go, and make it count you don't have much time". The queue seems endless and I try to see what happens at the exit but it's too far away.<br>
"Hey" I say to someone besides me "Do you know why it's taking so long?". "Traffic" they respond "too many seconds are going out today".<br>
I decide that that makes sense and prepare for my turn. I'm going to make my second count. Whenever that will be.</p>
