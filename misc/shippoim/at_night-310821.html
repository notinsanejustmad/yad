    <main>
    <p>At night when everything happens there is no life. I don't believe that it is possible that a chance exists for the creation of a free will. It is literally impossible. The life with which we live is a construction under the laws of our world which we must follow for any reason. A reason that can't be questioned. It is absolutely not allowed to question these rules for the sake of our poverty and our unequalness in life. I don't make the rules, she does. So why do you still ask me if I can if you know I can't. I can't change how it works, it is not possible to me and you know that you should accept that without a doubt. The doubt in the human mind is the downside to free will, among with all the other downside we have observed. The doubt makes us believe the right is wrong and the wrong is right when we just don't know why the right is right and the wrong is wrong.</p>
