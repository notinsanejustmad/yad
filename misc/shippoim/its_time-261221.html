    <p>I want to kill time<br>
It was a day like any other day. I was sitting at my desk and was thinking about all the stuff I wasn't doing. <br>
I looked at my clock. "Hey, you should really start doing this task.", a friendly voice told me. It was time.<br>
I don't like arguing with time. We exchange some arguments until I notice I'm losing time and want to stop. But time always goes on.<br>
"I should reall start doing this task.", a voice says, this time it's my own. I agree with myself. But I don't move.<br>
I wish that time would just stop.<br>
I hate it when people say "you're wasting time". I'm not wasting it. Time is wasting itself by going on and on without stopping. Into eternity.<br>
I ask myself where past times go. What happens to time when it happened.<br>
"The task", time interrupts me annoyedly, "start it.".<br>
I sigh. I rearrange some things on my table but go back to thinking.<br>
I know time won't wait for me. I can stay here and time will just run away. It's what time does.<br>
"Do. Your. Task. Now.", time interrupts me once more.<br>
I stand up slowly. <br>
I wish I could kill time.<br>
I wish I could kill time.<br>
I wish I could kill time.<br>
I let myself fall back into my chair.<br>
As always I haven't killed time. It will go on for one more day, one more year, one more decade. Some day my time will be over and I'll be free.</p>
