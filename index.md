## Welcome to my conlang's website (github thing [meh])

This website will be used to document my language's dictionary for easy accessibility (as y grammar is beautifully in a .tex file, which i may or may not provide here later on)
Also i will use this for random shit I or my friends make (without credit to them of course *laughs maniacally*).

### short introduction

Yad is a language originally made for _nothing_ but is now used in the language/worldbuilding game "Garden" alongside a variety of other people's conlangs!!
It is canonically spoken by a culture of mountain-dwelling peoples who have a strong conection to certain "spirit animals" like ravens or cats (the latter of which is scattered through my grammar documentation). The langugage is trying to achieve minimalism in word amount and I try to use not so much word compounding, which results in words having many meanings! example of this is the adjective "wi" which is used for "good; beautiful; shiny" or can just be an exclamation of approving.

### DISCLAIMER !!

I am shit at coding, so expect this to be shit!
The layout for my conlang pages will probably be made by me(!!), so it will probably look shit.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/notinsanejustmad/yad/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
