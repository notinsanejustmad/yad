     <p> Yad is a (at least aming to be) naturalistic a priori conlang and I have been working on it since the 25th October 2020. It was originally created for now purpose but i have now
       given it a purpose by implementing in the worldbuilding game "Garden" as my conculture's language. I have participated in a few (4) <a href="https://www.frathwiki.com/Conlang_relay" target="_blank">relays</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs" target="_blank">r/conlangs</a> Discord Network with this conlang. <i>Three</i> of those i didn't finish due to varying reasons, but I'm currently (February 2021) participating in my 4th one and im pretty sure I'm going to finish it this time!! Once the relay is over I will upload my text on this website.</p>
